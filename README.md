Our website provides information about light pollution as well as links to resources to learn more about how light pollution happens and how to prevent and reverse light pollution.
We also plan to implement a night sky viewer where users can input their location via longitude and latitude and get an image of the night sky in their area. We would also pull statistics about light pollution in their area and direct them to the resources page.

## The main page
This would be the page users first see when they visit the website. This would be the night sky viewer since this would likely generate the most traffic to the website. It would consist of a simple page layout with 2 box labeled "Longitude" and "Latitude". Under these boxes there would be a button that would lead to the image of the night sky.

### After Giving Us Your Location
We would pull an image of the night sky based on the inputs and display an image of the night sky. Right below the image would be information about light pollution in ther area which would direct people to the "Resources" page to learn more.

## Resources
This page would essentially be a wiki for light pollution to help educate people on the issue as well as potential practices to reduce their contributions.

## About Us
This is our personal plug page! There are pictures of all the group members and a brief bio. Links are also provided under each person.
